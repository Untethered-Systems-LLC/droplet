# Purpose

This toolkit is being developed as a part of the Fluid Project as to serve as a framework to develop its core applications and graphical interface. It is meant to be used as the standard way to write applications for the Fluid operating system on every device. Cross-platform compatibility is kept in mind to ensure that developers need not write platform-specific code in order to develop their software, without needing to resort to local PWA solutions, such as Electron.
